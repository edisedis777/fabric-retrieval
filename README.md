This project provides two Python notebooks for retrieving and managing Microsoft Fabric items efficiently, with minimal Capacity Unit usage. The notebooks are:
1. retrieval.ipynb: A comprehensive system for retrieving Fabric items, tracking changes, validating data quality, enabling incremental refreshes, and setting up alerts.
2. simple-retrieval.ipynb: A simplified version focused on basic retrieval and storage of Fabric items in Delta format.
- Both notebooks are designed to optimize resource usage compared to Spark notebooks and store data in Delta format for efficient analysis.

### Common Notes
- Dataflow Gen2 Exclusion: Dataflow Gen2 is not included in the Fabric items retrieved by either notebook.
- Scope Limitation: These notebooks only retrieve Fabric Items, not Power BI Items.
- Efficiency: Using Python notebooks consumes significantly fewer Capacity Units than Spark notebooks.

## Notebooks
1. retrieval.ipynb - Comprehensive Retrieval and Management
- This notebook provides a full-featured system for managing Microsoft Fabric items.

### Features
- Efficient Retrieval: Retrieves Fabric items with minimal Capacity Unit usage.
- Change Tracking: Monitors and records changes in Fabric item inventory over time.
- Data Quality Validation: Ensures data integrity through validation checks.
- Incremental Refreshes: Supports incremental updates to reduce processing overhead.
- Alerting System: Notifies users of significant changes in the Fabric item inventory.

### Usage
- Prerequisites: Install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries (e.g., requests, pandas, delta).
- Clone the Repository: Use git clone to download the project files.
- Configure the System: Adjust settings in the config dictionary within the notebook (see Configuration).
- Run the Notebook: Execute the notebook to start the retrieval and management process.

2. simple-retrieval.ipynb - **Simplified Retrieval**
- This notebook offers a streamlined approach for retrieving Fabric items, ideal for basic use cases.

### Features
- Efficient Retrieval: Retrieves all Fabric items with minimal Capacity Unit usage via the REST API.
- Data Storage: Stores results in Delta format for analysis and tracking.
- Lightweight Design: Focuses on core retrieval functionality without additional management features.

### Usage
- Prerequisites: Install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries (e.g., requests, pandas, deltalake).
- Clone the Repository: Use git clone to download the project files.
- Authenticate: Ensure Azure Key Vault secrets are accessible for authentication.
- Run the Notebook: Execute the notebook to retrieve and store Fabric items.

### Configuration
#### For retrieval.ipynb
- The system is configured via a config dictionary in the notebook. Key settings include:

- API and Authentication Settings:
- key_vault_url: Azure Key Vault URL.
- tenant_id_secret_name, client_id_secret_name, client_secret_name: Secret names in Key Vault.
- fabric_api_base_url: Fabric API base URL.
- api_scope: API authentication scope.
- Storage Paths: Paths for raw JSON, staging, production, changes, history, and quality issues Delta tables.
- Runtime Configurations: Incremental refresh toggle, history retention days, request delay, batch size.
- Alert Settings: Enable alerts, email recipients, SMTP server details, change threshold.
- Data Quality Thresholds: Minimum items, required fields, valid item types.

#### For simple-retrieval.ipynb
- Configuration is simpler and embedded in the code:

- Authentication: Uses Azure Key Vault for tenantid, powerbi-applicationid, and powerbi-clientsecret.
- Storage: Saves raw JSON to Files/Fabric_Items/ and Delta tables to /lakehouse/default/Tables/.

### Logging
- retrieval.ipynb: Logs execution details and errors to Files/Logs/fabric_items_<timestamp>.log.
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: Does not include dedicated logging; outputs are printed to the notebook.

### Alerting
- retrieval.ipynb: Sends email alerts for significant inventory changes (configurable via enable_alerts).
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: No alerting system included.

### Data Storage
Both notebooks store data in Delta format:

- retrieval.ipynb: Uses multiple tables (staging, production, changes, history, quality issues).
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: Stores data in staging (staging_all_fabric_items) and production (all_fabric_items) tables.

### Change Tracking
- retrieval.ipynb: Tracks changes (new, updated, deleted items) in a dedicated fabric_items_changes table.
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: Performs basic upsert operations to update the production table.

### Analysis Views
- retrieval.ipynb: Creates SQL views (e.g., usage trends, recent modifications, workspace growth).
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: No analysis views provided.

### Unit Tests
- retrieval.ipynb: Includes unit tests for critical functions like data quality checks.
- simple-retrieval.ipynb: No unit tests included.
